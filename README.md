# Data Mining Techniques ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python->=3.8-blue.svg)

Welcome to the Data Mining Techniques repository! Here, you'll find a collection of notebooks showcasing various data mining techniques implemented in Python.

## Getting Started

1. Make sure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed on your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies.

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Explore the notebooks at your liking!

## Linear Models

### Linear Classification
In this notebook, we delve into linear classification techniques. We generate two clusters of data randomly, each drawn over a straight line. Then, we separate these clusters using the Perceptron algorithm.

### Linear Regression
Explore linear regression using Gradient Descent! We start by manually implementing Gradient Descent on the London borough profiles dataset to predict the maximum.
